// MARK: - Word of the Day (M9)
//
// One curated word per day. Each entry carries:
//   • word — the headword the user is asked to use.
//   • partOfSpeech — short label ("noun", "verb", "adjective").
//   • definition — concise gloss (≤ 90 chars).
//   • promptSuggestion — a 30s speaking prompt that invites natural usage.
//
// Selection: deterministic Splitmix64 hash of the ISO date string indexes
// into the curated list, so the same day shows the same word on every
// device without needing backend coordination. The list is large enough
// (over a year of unique words) that no user hits a repeat inside a
// single year.
//
// Usage detection: the WordOfTheDayManager scans finalized session
// transcripts for case-insensitive matches against the headword AND its
// short morphological forms (defined per entry). The match is intentionally
// loose enough to forgive plurals / past-tense, but strict enough not to
// mis-trigger on substring overlaps ("art" inside "smart").
//
// Curation principles:
//   • Common-but-stretch — words an English speaker has heard but might
//     not actively reach for. Not SAT-prep; not Reader's Digest filler.
//   • Speakable — pronounceable in a single take, no Greek roots that
//     freeze the user mid-sentence.
//   • No politics, no identity targeting, no idioms tied to a single
//     country's media. Universal English.
